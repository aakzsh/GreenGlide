A flutter game focussed around the goal of achieving sustainability and encourage support for a more developed and environmentally educated world!

# Running Locally
The setup is easy to get along with

1. Firstly, clone the repository onto your local system ```git clone https://github.com/aakzsh/GreenGlide```
2. cd into the root directory, then run ```dart pub get```
3. Note that you'll need to setup your own firebase project with Firestore and Anonymous login, and add the android app in that.
4. For running the backend for google wallet locally, cd into backend directory, then run ```npm install``` ```node app.js```
5. Run the flutter app ```flutter run```
